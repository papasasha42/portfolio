# My Learning Curve

_This portfolio is work in progress. I take my projects created locally, clean up, refactor, remove sensitive information included by mistake and write readme's. After this I push code to this repository._

---

There is a list of separate projects or sets of small projects I make while learning immersive world of web technologies. I try to make README files helpful for potential employer, listing skills I learn and explaining what code does.

At the end of this document I will be listing most significant courses and books that I finished and those are in my read/watch list for 2019.

Also, I read hundreds of articles and official documentations which I sometimes feel are real books üòÇ

That was a lot of work, but I keep pushing and still lack hands on experience and work with awesome team on real world projects.
